# code-refactor

# Description
 We wanted to address the problems the code had due to low search engine optimization and accessibility. The lack of semantic html elements, alt tags on images and comments, meant that this webpage was not in a position to be seen very highly by search engines in general.

# Technologies
Project created with: 
<br>
VS code version 1.61.0

# Sources
A lot of time was spent researching naming conventions for classes, eventually BEM was chosen, though it may not have been used correctly. These were the resources that I used to research it.
